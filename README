1. The purpose of this library is to provide a simple
   object-oriented finite state machine in C.
   The idea is simple: the user has to define states as strings 
   and events (return values) as a positive enumeration.
   Also the user has to define actions which are triggered
   upon a state transition. The actions' return values are
   events. These events can be also explicitly fed into the state
   machine.
   The states, events and actions are tied together with the help
   of wfsm_add_transition_str function.
   A NOP event has to be explicitly set. This is needed for cases,
   when an event returns a value and the FSM needs to make decision
   whether it should continue with transitions or whether it should
   return.
2. The license is LGPL v3.
3. The code is still a work in progress.
