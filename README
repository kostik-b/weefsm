1. The purpose of this library is to provide a simple
   object-oriented finite state machine in c.
   The idea is simple: the user has to define states 
   and events (return values) as positive enumerations.
   Also the user has to define actions which are triggered
   upon a state transitiont. The actions' return values are
   events. These events can be also explicitly fed into the state
   machinel.
   The states, events and actions are tied together with the help
   of wfsm_add_transition function.
   A NOP event has to be explicitly set. This is needed for cases,
   when an event returns a value and the FSM needs to make decision
   whether it should continue with transitions or whether it should
   return.
