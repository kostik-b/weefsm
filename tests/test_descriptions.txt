The tests we need to do.

basic_test:
1. Imagine a simple network application, that has to read a message,
   analyze it and either generate a positive reply or an error.
2. Name each state and transitions:
    listening -> reading | on io
    reading -> listening | on csum failed
    reading -> processing | on csum succeeded
    processing -> reply_handshake | on success processing
    processing -> reply_error     | on failure processing
    reply_handshake -> listening | in any case
    reply_error -> listening     | in any case
3. When adding transition, print the start and end idx + action idx.
4. When performing transition, print start and end idx and action.
5. Each action should have its name as m_impl.
